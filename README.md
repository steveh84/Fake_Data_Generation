# Overview
This is an example of how to use the [Python Faker package](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/0.7.4/) to generate CSV data files filled with fake data. This is very useful when trying to source data files for use in a classroom environment where you need consistently structured data in CSV format which is filled with different datatypes to create variation across the datasets. This allows each student to work on their own unique dataset.

I discuss how I use this code in my introductory Python programming course on the [MSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uos.ac.uk/study/msc-data-science-artificial-intelligence/) degree at the [University of Suffolk](https://www.uos.ac.uk/) in [this LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/profstevenharris_i-teach-introductory-python-programming-on-activity-7264970888511381504-_WqG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

# Required Python Packages
pandas, numpy, random

# Usage
Run the fake_data.py file from the command line or your favourite Editor. The code will generate 30 CSV files with fake data related to the subject in the filename. The full list of CSV files generated are listed at the bottom of this page.

# Modifying
Each CSV file has its own function to generate the data for that file, as shown below, where the number of lines of data are controlled by `num_records`. `generate_and_save_datasets()` saves each dataset into its won CSV text file.

```python
# Retail Store Data
def generate_retail_store_data(num_records=100):
    data = {
        'Store ID': [fake.uuid4() for _ in range(num_records)],
        'Store Location': [fake.city() for _ in range(num_records)],
        'Product': [fake.word() for _ in range(num_records)],
        'Sale Date': [random_date('-6y', 'now') for _ in range(num_records)],
        'Quantity Sold': np.random.randint(1, 100, num_records),
        'Revenue (USD)': np.random.uniform(10, 1000, num_records)
    }
    return pd.DataFrame(data)
```

# ChatGPT
At the end of the python file, there is a copy of the ChatGPT prompt I used to generate the Python code. While it works well for a one-off generation of fake data, it could still be improved. Each function is defining the number of rows of data as 100 within its won functiona parameter. This should really be defined once and passed into the function as a paramter. However, as educators are often very busy, it worke well enough for the purpose of generating the data. The ChatGPT code could also be given to students as an exercise in itself, by askign the students to find ways in which to improve the code. 

If you need datasets for different topics, I suggest you use the ChatGPT prompt and modify the subject list. you do still need to check each datafile before handing it to students, but overall, this process is quite efficient, and it is the dta you need, not the code!
